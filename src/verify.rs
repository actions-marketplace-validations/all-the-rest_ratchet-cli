//! The pre-release check: a command whose output is compared with a committed
//! snapshot (SPEC §15).
//!
//! A **benchmark is a measurement, not a defect class**.  It has no meaningful
//! "baseline that may only sink" — the value moves in both directions and
//! only matters at the moment of a release.  So the pre-release check is **not**
//! a ratchet: it has **no direction**.  It runs in the release pipeline, not
//! in the commit gate: it needs the infrastructure the release needs, and a
//! permanent gate over a measurement would be noise.
//!
//! The mechanic is the drift gate (SPEC §7) with a different comparison: the
//! drift gate compares a *generated file* with its committed counterpart, the
//! pre-release check compares a *command output* with a committed snapshot.
//!
//! The engine never mutates the tree: the command writes to a temporary path
//! and the snapshot is only written by `--update`.  The snapshot itself — the
//! one file the engine owns — is restored after the command, byte-, mode- and
//! time-identical.
